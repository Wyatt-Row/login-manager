# login-manager
This is my first project, so im unfamiliar with the documentation process. The idea behind this project is to get me more comfortable with writing in different places, managing files, storing in json, data protections such as hashing, and general problem solving.

The idea is for the python script to handle two primary functions. Account login validation, and account creation. Both work with an external .json file to either check existing account details to validate login, or to check account details and update the accounts list in the event the user seeks to create the account.
